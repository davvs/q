## Synopsis

This project is that should wrap shell command and when those commands complete, q will tell the user in a very verbose way

## Code Example

```
q sleep 15
```

(After that sleep 15 is executed, a verybose screen popup is shown in the screen and noises are played)


```
sleep 10 &
[1] 15951
q -p 15951
```
(Watch the process 15951 until it exits and then prints a verbose message to the user)

For complete usage run:
```
q -h
```
## Motivation

When running large batch scripts that takes a long time I always seem to forget to get back and check if they're done. q helps me to remind me that they're completed.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:davvs/q.git
